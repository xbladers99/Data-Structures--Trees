/* In this program, the task is to find the sum of all nodes greater than equal to a node and replace the sum with the number itself. 
  The approach is to to do reverse inorder traversal and keep adding the sum. In this way, the last node(greatest) will have only sum of itself while
   the first(smallest) node will end up being replaced by sum of all nodes in the BST.*/
